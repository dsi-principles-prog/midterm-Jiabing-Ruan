1. Outlines the problem you have identified and states data source data (in README2.md)
The problem:  I would like to explore the relationship between solar radiation and other predictors/variables listed in this data set. Also, I would like to use useful predictors to better predict solar radiation.

The data source is from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/dronio/SolarEnergy/kernels?sortBy=hotness&group=everyone&pageSize=20&datasetId=1296&turbolinks%5BrestorationIdentifier%5D=6dcbad5c-4b7c-488a-8646-60a8eeeb8bcd
